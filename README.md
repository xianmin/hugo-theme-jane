## Quick Start

**Note:**  This tutorial assumes that you are using [Hugo][] for **the first time** . [Hugo][] is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. You can check the [Hugo Official Docs][] for more help.

[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io/
[Hugo Official Docs]: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/



### 1. Install Hugo & Dart Sass

Download the appropriate version for your platform from [Hugo Releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin` is the most probable location.

Install Dart Sass, refer to the official documentation: https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#dart-sass .

### 2. Create a New Site

```bash
hugo new site myBlog
```

The above will create a new Hugo site in a folder named `myBlog`.



### 3. Use Hugo-Theme-Jane

Clone this repository into `themes` folder:

```bash
cd myBlog
git clone https://github.com/xianmin/hugo-theme-jane.git --depth=1 themes/jane
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative, installation as a module</summary>

If you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed you can install the theme as a [hugo module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/), then there will be no need to clone it into the `themes` folder:

```bash
hugo mod init example.com/my-blog
```

After that, you would need to use `github.com/xianmin/hugo-theme-jane` as your `theme` and not `hugo-theme-jane` in your `config.toml` file.

</details>

Copy the example site content:

```bash
cp -r themes/jane/exampleSite/content ./
```

Copy the default site config:

```bash
cp themes/jane/exampleSite/hugo.toml ./
```

Take a look at the example site:

```bash
hugo server
```

Open http://localhost:1313/ , you will see your site running with the example content.



### 4. Start a Blog

The default config file `hugo.toml` is located in your site root directory. You can customize it to match the details of your site.  Documentation about configuring Hugo can be found in the [Official Documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/)

The default content files are located in the `./content/post` directory.



### 5. Generate Your Website

Run `hugo` , this generates your website to the `public/` directory by default.

Nice work!

If you have extra time or want to know more about [Hugo][] , check out the awesome  [Hugo Official Docs][] .



## Site Configuration

Take a look in the [exampleSite](https://github.com/xianmin/hugo-theme-jane/tree/master/exampleSite) folder.

This directory contains an example config file and the content for the demo.
It serves as an example setup for you to configure to your liking.

Copy the `hugo.toml` to the root directory of your website. Overwrite the existing config file if necessary.



## Single Post Configuration

**Front Matter** : Hugo allows you to add front matter in yaml, toml, or json to your content files.

**YAML Example:**

```yaml

```



## Multilingual (Language) Support

Hugo-Theme-Jane supports the creation of websites with multiple languages side by side.

You should define the available languages in a `languages` section in your site configuration.

Translations are collected from the `i18n/` folder.

To use the translations:

```toml
# use Chinese translation
defaultContentLanguage = "zh-cn"  # Default language to use (if you set up multilingual support)
[Languages.zh-cn]
  languageCode = "zh-cn"
```

To use the Multilingual Mode, see [Multilingual Mode | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/) .
